Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:

Data Exploration and Cleaning

Initial inspection of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.

Feature Engineering

Creating new features to improve the modelâ€™s predictive power.

Transforming categorical variables into numerical representations.

Model Development

Building machine learning models to predict churn.

Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Interpretation and Insights

Analyzing model outputs to derive actionable business insights.

Identifying key factors contributing to customer churn.
